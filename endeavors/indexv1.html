					<h2>Northwestern University Undergraduate Studies</h2>
					<p class="time">September 2013-Present</p>
					<p class="edescript">I'm a full time student in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences at Northwestern University.  I am majoring in  <a href="http://www.cogsci.northwestern.edu/major.php" target="_blank">Cognitive Sciences</a> and minoring in <a href="http://www.math.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/degreeReqs.html#minor" target="_blank"> Mathematics</a>.  I expect to graduate with a B.A. in June of 2017.  My coursework can be found <a href="coursework.html">here</a>.</p>

					<h2><a href="http://acnl.psych.northwestern.edu" target="_blank">Affective Clinical Neuroscience Laboratory</a></h2>
					<p class="time">October 2013-Present</p>
					<p class="edescript">I work as a research assistant in the lab.  My work as of yet has mostly centered on investigation of reward-related processing via electroencephalography (EEG), using the method of Event Related Potentials (ERP) to investigate electrical responses to reward-related stimuli. I am also involved in similar work that uses funtional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).<br /><br />This past summer, I used these methods to investigate the interaction between Gratification-Delay and relative anticipation/reactivity to reward.  This project was funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute via the competitively awarded <a href="http://www.nuvibe.northwestern.edu/bioscientist/overview/" target="_blank">NU BioScientist grant</a>.  The proposal for the work can be found <a href="proposal.pdf">here</a>, and a poster summarizing my findings can be found <a href="poster.pdf">here</a>.</p>

					<h2><a href="http://www.numun.org" target="_blank">Northwestern University Model United Nations (NUMUN)</a></h2>
					<p class="time">September 2013-Present</p>
					<p class="edescript">NUMUN is an annual Model United Nations conference for high school students organized by Northwestern students. I serve as Secretary-Parliamentarian for NUMUN XI, the conference to be held in April of 2015.  This position entails creation/optimization of parliamentary debating procedure for the conference, as well as general staff management.<br /><br />For NUMUN X this past year, I served as a committee chair, organizing a simulation of the International Court of Justice for ~15 students with a staff of two other students.  We wrote topic papers for and managed student debate for three topics: <a href="senkaku.pdf">Sino-Japanese Territorial Disputes</a>, <a href="forest.pdf">Southeast Asian Deforestation</a>, and <a href="whales.pdf">Whale Conservation</a>.</p>
